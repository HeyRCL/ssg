This document serves as a guide to beginning Doomsday players (the Doomsday storm deck in the Legacy 
Format of Magic: The Gathering).

This document is deliberately not an exhaustive list of all the Doomsday piles that you can 
build. The current collection of piles in this document is intended to illustrate what combinations 
of resources lead to what kind of piles and storm counts. It important to develop an intuition for 
this as you will often find that you are sculpting your hand to play towards a set of resources that 
allow you to combo off. I think that reading through a pile document and trying out the piles that 
are there helps in building such an intuition.

Over time more in depth discussion of certain thought processes or pile building
styles will be added as more members of the Doomsday community contribute them.
These discussions will provide more explanation into some of the key concepts of 
a certain pile collective and explain the step by step run through of how to run 
through them. 

Some piles are designed to win via other methods other than lethal Tendrils of Agony. 
These piles will not have a storm count associated with them as it would not be required
for them.

## Notation

| Shorthand | &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp | Cardname |
| --------- | - | ---- |
| TW | | Three Wishes |
| AoI | | Act on Impulse |
| IU | |Ideas Unbound |
| LED | | Lion's Eye Diamond |
| GP | | Gitaxian Probe |
| BW | | Burning Wish |
| ToA | | Tendrils of Agony |
| LM | | Laboratory Maniac |
| BS | | Brainstorm |
| P | | Ponder |
| LP | | Lotus Petal |
| DD | | Doomsday |
| DR | | Dark Ritual |
| IC | | Infernal Contract |
| CB | | Conjurer's Bauble |
| SI | | Shelldock Isle |
  
Mana costs are represented as follows:  
W White - U Blue - B Black - R Red - G Green  
1 one generic mana  
BBB means three black mana  
1UU means two blue mana and one generic mana  
X means a variable amount of generic mana

Consider the following example of a Doomsday pile in this notation:
```
-> IU, LED, GP, LED, BW(ToA) BBB+1UU (6) 8 Storm
```
This means that IU is the top card and BW is the bottom card. BBB+1UU 
represents the mana cost, (6) is the converted mana cost. 8 Storm 
represents the amount of storm that executing this pile will generate, 
this includes the Doomsday you've cast to create this pile as well as 
the Tendrils of Agony (including the non-copy original spell) at the end 
of the pile. The original Tendrils is included for simplicity, because 
we simply count to ten if we want to cause 20 lifeloss. I will 
frequently leave out the wishtarget for BW at the end of the pile, 
because it is obvious that it is used for Tendrils of Agony.

## Karakas Piles/Kill Spell Piles:

For these piles you can replace Karakas with any kill or
removal spell, such as Slaughter Pact, Chain of Vapor or
Deathmark and increase storm by 1, donâ€™t forget to add the
cost of the spell to the cost listed here.

```
GP in hand:
-> IU, LED, GP, Karakas, ToA            BBB+1UU (6)  6 Storm
-> TW, LED, GP, Karakas, ToA            BBB+2UU (7)  6 Storm
-> AoI, LED, GP, Karakas, ToA           BBB+3R  (7)  6 Storm

GP + BW(IC):
-> LED, Karakas, DR, LP, ToA            BBB+2R (6)   8 Storm

GP + BW(AoI)
-> LED, Karakas, LED, GP, ToA           BBB+2R (6)   8 Storm
```

## Double-Doomsday Piles

Double-Doomsday piles have become much less attractive 
with the banning of Sensei's Divining Top. Much of the 
high storm count of these piles was due to replaying SDT 
again and again, Gitaxian Probe can provide some free 
draws, but the cost in mana/life becomes pretty high.

Costs written as [x/y] means you have to pay either.
```
GP + LED:
-> TW, LED, GP, DD, BW              BBB+[1UU/BBB] (6)   13 Storm
-> TW, LED, LED, GP, BW

-> AoI, LED, GP, DD, BW             BBB+[2R/BBB] (6)    13 Storm
-> AoI, LED, LED, GP, BW

TW:
-> LED, GP, DD, LED, BW             BBB+1UU (6)         10 Storm
-> TW, LED, LED, BW, X

TW + GP:
-> LED, LED, GP, DD, BW             BBB+1UU (6)         13 Storm
-> TW, LED, LED, GP, BW

CB in play + GP:
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, BW             BBB+1UUR (7)        13 Storm
-> IU, LED, GP, LED, BW
```

## Doomsday-Time Spiral Piles

For these piles you sometimes need some cards in hand or post-Doomsday graveyard, to prevent decking 
yourself when casting TS. Remember that Doomsday is always in your post-Doomsday graveyard and that 
the Burning Wish used to wish for Time Spiral, as well as Time Spiral are exiled. Mana cost in square 
brackets [ ] can be paid using your lands after they were untapped by Time Spiral.

```
GP + 1 card:
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, BW              BBB+1UUR+[1R] (7)   11 Storm

GP + LED:
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, BW              BBB+UU+[1] (5)      13 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, BW              BBB+R+[1R] (4)      13 Storm

GP + IU in hand:
-> LED, LED, LED, BW, BW             BBB+UU+[1] (5)      13 Storm

2x GP in hand + BW in hand or post-DD graveyard:
-> LED, IU, LED, LED, BW             BBB+R+[1R] (4)      14 Storm
-> LED, IU, LED, LED, BW             BBB+1R+[1] (5)      14 Storm

BS in hand + 2 cards:
-> P, LED, LED, BW, BW               BBB+2UU+[1R] (7)    11 Storm

BS/Ponder + Brainstorm + 2 cards:
-> LED, LED, LED, BW, BW             BBB+UU+[1] (5)      13 Storm

BS + BW + GP:
-> LED, LED, BW, LP, LP              BBB+2U+[1] (6)      13 Storm

BS + GP + 1 card:
-> LED, LED, BW, BW, LP              BBB+2U+[1] (6)      12 Storm
```


## Pass the turn Piles using Time Spiral

For these piles you sometimes need some cards in hand or
post-Doomsday graveyard, to prevent decking yourself when
casting TSP. Remember that Doomsday is always in your
post-Doomsday graveyard and that the Burning Wish used to
wish for Time Spiral, as well as Time Spiral are exiled.

```
2 cards in hand or graveyard:
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, BW              1UUR (4)     9 Storm
-> TW, LED, LED, BW, BW              3UU  (5)     9 Storm
-> AoI, LED, LED, BW, BW             4R   (5)     9 Storm

LED in play + 1 card:
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, BW              UU   (2)     10 Storm
-> TW, LED, LED, BW, BW              1UU  (3)     10 Storm

IU in hand + 1 card:
-> LED, LED, LED, BW, BW             UU   (2)     11 Storm

TW in hand + 1 card:
-> LED, LED, LED, BW, BW             1UU  (3)     11 Storm
```

Essentially you want your draw spell + 2 LEDs + 2 BWs as 5
cards, so you may have any of these in hand or post-DD
graveyard as long as you can resolve Burning Wish->Time
Spiral.

## Pass the turn Piles for double-Doomsday

Costs written as [x/y] means you have to pay either.

```
LED in play:
-> TW, LED, GP, DD, BW              1UU (3)         9 Storm
-> TW, LED, LED, BW(ToA), X

-> IU, LED, CB, DD, BW              1UU (3)         9 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW(ToA), X
```

## Pass the turn Piles using Chain of Vapor

```
GP in hand:
-> IU, LED, LED, CoV, BW             UUU (3)      9 Storm

LED in play:
-> IU, LED, GP, CoV, BW              UUU (3)      8 Storm

BW + GP + 1 card:
-> GP, BS, LED, LED, CoV             UU (2)       10 Storm
```

## Pass the turn piles with Laboratory Maniac

```
Nothing:
-> TW, LED, GP, GP, LM               1UU          4 life

LED in play:
-> GP, TW, LED, GP, LM               0            4 life

GP in hand:
-> LED, TW, LED, GP, LM              0            4 life
```

### Chromatic Sphere (CS) piles
```
Nothing:
-> IU, CS, LED, GP, LM               2UU          2 life

LED:
-> GP, IU, CS, DR, LM                1B           2 life

GP in hand:
-> LED, IU, CS, DR, LM               1B           2 life
```

### Lab Man pass the turn with protection

Different piles are listed for different purposes.
Some piles play around a single counterspell or any single card in hand.
Some variants only play around removal on Lab Man.
In these piles I use Silence, this can obviously be replaced with any other spell if you prefer.

```
GP in hand:
-> Silence, IU, LP, GP, LM           W+2UU        4 life
-> Silence, TW, LED, GP, LM          W+1UU        4 life
-> Silence, AoI, LED, GP, LM         W+2R         4 life
-> LED, IU, Silence, GP, LM          W+2          4 life

LED:
-> GP, IU, Silence, GP, LM           W+2          4 life
-> GP, TW, Silence, GP, LM           W+2U         4 life

```

## Conjurer's Bauble (CB) piles

These piles generally require a CB to be
in play post DD. They either use the CB or 
another cantrip to draw into the pile and have
the option of looping CBs for additional storm.

```
GP in hand:
-> CB, TW/AoI, LED, CB, BW           BBB+[1UU/2R]+2+X (5)    9+X Storm

CB in play:
-> IC, LED, LED, CB, BW              BBB+BBB1+X (7+X)        7+X Storm

-> GP, TW/AoI, LED, CB, BW           BBB+[1UU/2R]+1+X (7+X)  8+X Storm
-> GP, TW/AoI, LED, CB, ToA          BBB+[1UU/2R]+0+X (6+X)  8+X Storm
